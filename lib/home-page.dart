 * Please, use this class for your solution.

 * There are several paths for your to follow

 * 
 * 1. You can simply put all of your logic inside one huge StatefullWidget
 *  and be completely happy with that
 * 
 * - or -
 * 
 * 2. You can separate your concerns a little and try to split your UI
 * into pieces and find some good places to apply both StatelessWidget and
 * StatefullWidget
 * 
 * If you feel a bit off the track or you fell some lack of context
 * feel free to consult with the offical Flutter introduction to
 * widgets:
